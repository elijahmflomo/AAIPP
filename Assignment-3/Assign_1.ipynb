        "\n",
        "*   A Python dictionary was effectively used to store and manage tariff data for different customer types, including Energy Charges (EC), Fixed Charges (FC), Customer Charges (CC), and Electricity Duty (ED) rates.\n",
        "*   The application successfully reads user inputs for units consumed and customer type.\n",
        "*   The calculation logic for each charge type (EC, FC, CC, ED) was implemented, with ED being calculated on the sum of the other charges.\n",
        "*   Case-insensitivity for customer type input was addressed to ensure correct tariff data retrieval.\n",
        "*   The final total bill is calculated by summing up all individual charges.\n",
        "*   The output is displayed in a clear format resembling a physical bill, showing a breakdown of each charge and the total amount.\n",
        "*   An optional verification step allows users to compare calculated charges against their physical bill values, highlighting discrepancies.\n",
        "*   Slab rates for Energy Charges based on consumption were incorporated into the tariff data structure, and the calculation logic was updated to handle these slabs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current implementation assumes a simple tariff structure for ED calculation. Future enhancements could involve more complex tax structures or additional fees found on physical bills.\n",
        "*   To improve the verification step, the application could provide more specific feedback on potential reasons for discrepancies, such as incorrect units entered or outdated tariff rates in the application.\n"
